GetCleanDataProject
===================

This is a getting and cleaning data course project repository.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with,
and clean a data set. And the goal is to prepare a tidy data.

The goal of tidy data is each variable forms a column, each observations forms 
a row, and each table stores data about one kind of observation.
The R script, run_analysis.R, uses the Human Activity Recognition 
Using Smartphones Dataset from the Smartlab (www.smartlab.ws) and creates a tidy 
data. The tidy data set is average of each variable for each activity and each 
subject.

- Subject: a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years
- Activity: Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
        (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
- Variables: Using embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, many sensor signals
        were captured and calculated from time and frequency domain. 
        
Please see the CodeBook.md for more information on the variables, the data, and 
cleaning data to get a tidy data set.
